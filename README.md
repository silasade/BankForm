# BankForm
A frontend for a bank application
Go to settings 
Then pages
Click on the url to go to the website(it has been hosted)
The form:
we have 2 buttons in the create account page
The login button is a link to the login page
The create button submits.....You can't submit without filling all the details
after clicking the create button, you are directed to the details page 
The login page also contains 2 buttons we have the create and login
Create is a link to the login page while  login is a submit button
Note this is just the frontend i also submitted the backend for the simple bank application that was built with php(https://github.com/silasade/BankForm-Backend.git)
i would also like to do backend web development
Note i used bootstrap for the navbar so it would need internet to function
